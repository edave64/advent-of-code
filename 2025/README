# AoC 2025 in Swift

## Usage

You can run specific days with:

```
swift run edave64-aoc-2025 {day} {a/b}
```

So for example, to run day 5, part A:

```
swift run edave64-aoc-2025 5 a
```

To run with sample input, use the `--sample` flag

You can run benchmarks with:

```
swift run edave64-aoc-2025 {day} {a/b} --benchmark
```

Note that benchmarking always runs both parts, so the one you pass is actually ignored.

You can also read in the input from stdin with the `--stdin` flag. In that case, you can ignore the
following Setup section.

## Setup

Before you can run the project, you need to download the puzzle data. Create a folder called `Data`
in the root of the project and create files called `sample{day}.txt` and `input{day}.txt` in it.
